            <h2>Research Question</h2>
            

            <p>How do fans’ preferences and opinions vary between The Hunger Games books and their movie adaptations in terms of storytelling, character development and emotional impact? What do these differences tell us about how film adaptations of novels influence cultural perception? </p>

            <p><strong>Background:</strong> As an avid reader I am always anticipating film adaptations of my favorite novels. However, not all of these movies live up to my expectations. In fact some adaptations vary so significantly from the original book that it can ruin the overall experience of the story. I believe that these differences in opinions between books and their movies can reveal interesting truths about what consumers view as enjoyable and important when reviewing a piece of content. By understanding the necessities for creating a successful movie adaptation according to the viewers, movie producers and directors can learn and adapt to reflect public opinion, since it is these viewers that ultimately pay their salaries.

        <section id="data">
            <h2>Data & Methods</h2>

            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            <!-- TODO: Describe your data collection and methodology -->
            <p><strong>Data Source:</strong> The first step after establishing a research question and developing a hypothesis is collecting enough useful data to successfully complete analysis methods on. I decided to gather data from both The Hunger Games and its sequel Catching Fire. Using data scraping methods, I collected information from Amazon, Goodreads, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDB for a total of eight data sets. I felt that it was important to use two data sets for each piece of content in an attempt to gather all possible opinions on the piece with as little biases as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Collection Method:</strong> I collected all of my data using the Instant Data Scraper extension. I felt that this was the easiest and most efficient way to collect large data sets such as the ones I used for the completion of this project. </p>
            <p><strong>Dataset Size:</strong> I used a total of eight data sets for the completion of this project. Each data set was unique in length, ranging from as small as thirty reviews to up to one hundred data entries. The dates on these sets also vary, as each set included reviews beginning at the time of the literary piece's release all the way to present day. </p>
            <p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Ethical management of data collection is always important when conducting research. It is important that all information used is sourced ethically and gives credit to the original creator. For my project, the considerations that I took into account was attributing credit for all data sets to the respective website where I scraped the information from. This is important since I, myself did not create these data sets and therefore I cannot take credit for doing so. In research it is also important that nobody is facing any ramifications from the results of your project. Since my project deals with reviews posted online, all information is already avaliable to the general public and therefore is ethical to use for this research project.  </p>

            <h3>Analysis Methods</h3>
            <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python (pandas, VADER, Gensim)</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Term Frequency Analysis:</strong> The first computational method I used was word frequency analysis. I decided that computing the most frequently used words would be important in understanding what reviewers were saying about the particular piece. I predicted that character names and key plot points would show up the most frequently as they are most recognized and criticized.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis (VADER):</strong> The next computational method that I conducted was sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis gives an overview of the tone of the data set using key words that it deems either positive or negative. Since this series is very highly rated across numerous platforms, I predicted that the overall sentiment analysis would be positive. I did think that the book reviews would be slightly higher than the movies as expressed in my research hypothesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Topic Modeling (Gensim LDA):</strong> The last method I chose to include was topic modeling. Topic modeling is important because it gives general ideas or topics that are expressed the most throughout the reviews. By understanding which topics are the most prevalent, I can discover what elements are important to consumers and how these topics are influencing their opinion of the content. Similarly to word frequency, I predicted that topic modeling would reveal most ideas being centered around the characters in the story or big pieces of the plot. For each of my data sets I chose to compute five topics. I felt that five was the best number as it allowed for variety to show up without running into the risk of overly repetitive topics. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="analysis">
            <h2>Results & Analysis</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Add visualizations and code snippets -->
             
            <h3>Sentiment Analysis Results</h3>
            <p> Sentiment score analysis results varied differently from what I had originally expected. My prediction was that sentiment scores would be incredibly high for all of these data sets as the reviews for these novels and movies are relatively positive across the board. However, during computations I kept receiving moderate to neutral overall sentiment score ratings. I was very surprised when my results were ranging anywhere from 0.3 to 0.6. While these scores are not drastically low and do lean more on the positive side, I was confused because after scanning over the data sets by hand, I was not seeing a significant enough amount of negative reviews to justify such a low score. What I discovered was that the VADAR computational method was misinterpreting words from the reviews and labeling them as negative when in reality they were just describing parts of the story. Words such as “hunger” and “fighting” were being interpreted as negative even if the review was praising the piece. This flaw was causing high-rating reviews to earn negative sentiment scores, ultimately dragging down the average sentiment score of the whole piece. Things like this are important to recognize and address as they can alter the entirety of your research.  This mistake also showcases the need for human analysis in addition to computational analysis as there are just some things that computers can’t understand such as the use of sarcasm and connotations of certain words.</p>

            <h3>Code Example</h3>
            <p>Here's how I implemented the sentiment analysis using <code>vaderSentiment</code>:</p>

            <div class="code-title">sentiment_analysis.py</div>
            <pre><code>from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import pandas as pd

analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Analyze sentiment for each text
df['compound'] = df['text'].apply(
    lambda x: analyzer.polarity_scores(x)['compound']
)

# Classify sentiment
df['sentiment'] = df['compound'].apply(
    lambda x: 'positive' if x > 0.05
    else ('negative' if x < -0.05 else 'neutral')
)</code></pre>

            <h3>Topic Modeling Results</h3>
            <p>Using Gensim's LDA implementation, I identified 5 major topics...</p>

        <section id="findings">
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Present your main discoveries -->

            <p>The computational analysis revealed three major insights:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Finding 1:</strong> The most frequently used words centered around characters from the novel or crucial parts of the plot such as war and fighting. </li>
                <li><strong>Finding 2:</strong> Sentiment score was relatively the same for all eight data sets, averaging anywhere between 0.3 and 0.6.</li>
                <li><strong>Finding 3:</strong> All eight data sets revealed similar topics of interest within the reviews. Most topics revolved around either character development or background information of the story. Very few reviews mentioned anything to do with writing, casting or acting. </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Detailed Results</h3>
            <p>Breaking down the sentiment distribution:</p>
            <p>This is the sentiment anaylsis breakdown for The Hunger Games novel using Amazon reviews (one out of eight data sets).</p>

            <h3>What Surprised Me</h3>
            <p></p>  My original hypothesis was that I predicted The Hunger Games novels to receive more support and appreciation than the film adaptations. However, I do not think there was enough data-driven evidence to support this claim. Instead I argue that the films and novels were equally loved by fans for much of the same reasons. No data analysis method revealed that fans were left missing things or longing for more from the movies. My original hypothesis was not completely correct however I do think there are some reasonable explanations for this. One of my guesses is that the audiences reviewing the book were different from the audiences reviewing the movies. Therefore they were not comparing one to the other, instead they were just taking the piece as is.

            <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Connect to course frameworks -->

            <p>This project demonstrates what happens when coding meets culture by revealing insights that neither computational analysis nor traditional close reading could discover alone.</p>

            <h3>Integration of Methods</h3>
            <p><strong>What computational methods revealed:</strong>  In the specific case of my project, computational analysis revealed how similar the reviews were between all of the data sets. Upon first glance, each of the reviews may have seemed unique and different. However, topic modeling revealed that the majority of these reviews revolved around the same central themes, showcases how similar each data set really was. This might have been missed if close reading was used alone, as it is easy to ignore the data from other sets and instead zero in on one specific thing at a time</p>
            <p><strong>What close reading added:</strong> Computers are extremely useful tools when conducting research. However at the end of the day it is just a machine that cannot do all of the things humans can. That is why even if we use computational methods of research, it is crucial that we also integrate close reading and review into our final results as well. For my project, the utilization of close reading practices identified the mistakes happening in sentiment analysis conduction due to the computer not being able to understand sarcasm or word connatations. By identifying this mistake, I was able to develop more accurate estimates of the overall tone, or sentiment, of each of the data sets. </p>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h3>📐 Classification Logic</h3>
                <p>This project connects to <strong>Classification Logic</strong> by revealing how algorithmic categorization shapes our understanding of cultural perceptions of film adaptations. This project engages directly with Classification Logic by examining how algorithmic systems sort, label and organize information about opinions towards popular novel's film adaptations. In doing so, it explains how this information shapes our cultural understandings of these literary pieces through emphasis on certain aspects, such as plot and character development, while disengaging with others. . </p>

                <p><em>Critical question:</em> What nuances are lost when we reduce complex cultural expressions to computational categories?
            <p></p>When complex cultural works are reduced to computational categories, we lose the messy, controdictory, culturally charged richness that makes interpreation not only possible but meaningful as well. What is left over is a simplified version, useful for basic descrpitions, but incapable of truly representing the full landscape that is the piece. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h3>🤖 AI Agency</h3>
                <p>The use of topic modeling and sentiment analysis demonstrates <strong>AI Agency</strong> concerns. While the algorithms appear to "discover" meaning, the interpretation and framing of results remains entirely human. Topic modeling and sentiment anaylsis don't give AI agency, they simply expose how embedded human analysis is in every step of any computational method. These algorithms structure insights in a way the must be reviewed and intepreted constantly by human brains. This integration between technoloy and human power is precisely what this project attempts to showcase. </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Limitations & Future Directions</h3>
            <p><strong>What I would do differently:</strong> Overall I am very happy with how the process of this project happened. If I could go back and do it again, I think the only thing I would have done differently would be to develop code that would compare results side by side, instead of having to manually compare each data set to one another by hand. By designated one coding notebook to each individual data set, I had to flip back and forth many times in order to make any sort of comparisons between final results. I think it would have been slighly easier if I would have created one coding notebook for multiple data sets so that the information was all in one place and easily accessible for comparisions. </p>
            <p><strong>Questions that remain:</strong>
                <p></p> Who are viewers blaming for bad movie adaptaptions? Screenwriters? Directors and Producers? Actors? </p> 
            <p> Do adadptations do a better job of capturing the essence of a novel when the original author is a part of the film making process?</p>
            <p><strong>Confidence in conclusions:</strong> I am fairly confident in my results as I have evidence from four different sources backing me up. By comparing numerous data sets in a variety of ways, my insights have developed in a way that is logical and replicable. The major limitation that I had to keep in mind when conducting my analysis, that others should take into consideration as well, is that not every person who has consumed the highlighted content is going to write a review about it. In fact most people are not going to, which means that it may be hard to generalize the information from this research to the entire population.
